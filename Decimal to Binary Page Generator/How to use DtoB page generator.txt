Explanation:
	The script generates a pdf array of bits where a dot is a 1, and an empty space is a 0.
	The first number is on the left side of the paper, and the least significant bit is at the bottom.
	You may run into errors when running the script. Make sure you have the following python package installed:
		pip install fpdf
	If you are still running into errors, your input is formatted incorrectly. There are three different ways you can use the script.
	Read the rest to understand how to format your commands.

Generate 30 random numbers between -2^49 and (2^49)-1:
	Run the script with no command line arguments

Use a text file of numbers:
	Create a text file consisting of only integer numbers separated by only commas. Ex: "67,785,7909,-178"
	Run the script with the text file name as your only argument (make sure the text file and script are in the
	same directory). Ex: "python DtoBPage.py mynums.txt"

Use a list of numbers straight from command line:
	Run the script with 30 or less numbers as command line arguments. Ex: "python DtoBPage.py 87 6758 -7986 897"
